I wrote less code as possible to solve the exercise. <br>
I've been using enumeration where possible, cause it will be easy to extend this model without modifying a lot of code.

I have used BigDecimal cause I don't want to lose any decimal in calculations, even if it is not the best option cause at one point you have to rounding the value, so for now without any other informations I choose 3 decimal.

The package stock.share contains the code for testing and also for running the application.

Launch the main to run the application
